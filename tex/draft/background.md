> A High-Performance Framework for Dynamic Cache-Replacement-Strategy-Selection in Distributed Shared Memory Systems

# Background
> Various Kinds of (Distributed) Systems (What makes a system "distributed", anyways?) $\rightarrow$ 
> (Distributed) Cache Replacement Algorithms (Strategies) $\rightarrow$ 
> Limitations to common distributed cache replacement practices in extremely time-sensitive scenarios (like ours) $\rightarrow$
> Variables that need to be accounted for in cache replacement problms $\rightarrow$ 
> Need for dynamic manipulation to cache replacement strategy, which implies probing & measurement & comparison, etc. $\rightarrow$ 
> Framework for such a thing, which is what we explore in this paper.
